- Dot5  activity -- the main activity of the app

-- Present according to a grammar the text pieces through D5TextView the argument and time & day settings for the chosen Dot5 activity 
-- Choose/switch D5Act             ... => D5Choose - default
-- Choose time and day             ... => D5Time   - default
-- Configure the selected activity ... => D5Config - custom
-- Launch activity                 ... => D5Act    - custom

~~~ Kernel ~~~

- D5Setup extends Activity implements D5Setting (better name?)

-- instance of it would correspond to text pieces backed by D5TextView
-- an abstract class with specific interface method(s) for setting results
--- may also need an auxiliary class (inner class of D5Setup) for wrapping the results
-- a D5Setup subclass should deal with its own data persistence

-- D5Time
--- extends D5Setup
--- Configure time ... arguments for alarm clock
--- Returns an update string-activity pair for display in Dot5 activity
--- No direct interaction with D5Act

-- D5Choose extends D5Setup
--- If there are no alternative activity, then "untouchable" (i.e. no UI for choosing)
--- Is it possible to get information from the manifest and auto populate the list of supported Dot 5 activities?
--- No direct interaction with D5Act



~~~ D5 Activity ~~~

- To implement support for a Dot5 activity
-- extend D5Config to implement configuration of the acitivity
-- extend the Dot5Act abstract class to be launched by "do it now" or by alarm clock
-- Data sharing between D5Act and D5Config is completely open

- D5Config
-- extends D5Setup
-- Configure activity ... arguments for either D5Act or other app
-- Returns an updated string-activity pair for display in Dot5 activity
-- Data sharing with D5Act is completely open

- D5Act
-- The Android activity doing of it ...
--- Potentially does nothing more than launching a third party app: specifying arguments for other apps


~~~ Example: Reading ~~~

- D5ReadConfig extends D5Config
- D5ReadAct extends D5Act
