- Dot5 Android Activities

-- Dot5
--- The main activity of the app, shown whenever it isn't time to act/remind
--- Present through D5TextViews the settings for the chosen Dot5 activity
    according to a grammar
---- The elements are: Dot5What, Dot5How, and Dot5When
--- "Now" to start doing it immediately
---- If "Now" is used here, cancels alarm for the day

-- Dot5What
--- Specify intended action
--- Configure the intended action
--- Custom

-- Dot5Which (for future)
--- Choose available intended actions

-- Dot5When
--- Time & day to start/remind about the action
--- 'OK' sets alarm(s)

-- Dot5Pause
--- Launched when alarm(s) go off
--- Show reminder: "time to do it!" / "do you want to do it now?"
--- Options: "Now" & "Later" / "Now" & "Later"
---- When no more "laters"/"reminders" -- default to 3, show only "Start Now"

-- Dot5Action
--- Accompanying activity launched from "Now"
--- or launch another app          ... => ... protocol for specifying app and arguments


~~~ Kernel design (Android) ~~~

- D5Setup extends Activity implements D5Setting (better name?)

-- instance of it would correspond to text pieces backed by D5TextView
-- an abstract class with specific interface method(s) for setting results
--- may also need an auxiliary class (inner class of D5Setup) for wrapping the results
-- a D5Setup subclass should deal with its own data persistence

-- D5When
--- extends D5Setup
--- Configure time ... arguments for alarm clock
--- Returns an update string-activity pair for display in Dot5 activity
--- No direct interaction with Dot5Action

(TODO)
-- D5Which extends D5Setup
--- If there are no alternative activity, then "untouchable" (i.e. no UI for choosing)
--- Is it possible to get information from the manifest and auto populate the list of supported Dot 5 activities?
--- No direct interaction with Dot5Action

-- D5What extends D5Setup
--- ...

-- D5How extends D5Setup
--- Could be launched from D5What
--- Could also be launched from Dot5


~~~ D5 ___ Activity ~~~

- TAI: this presumably could be done as a widget!

- To implement support for a Dot5 activity called '___'
-- extend D5Setup to implement configuration of the acitivity
-- extend the Dot5Act abstract class to be launched by "do it now" or by alarm clock
-- Data sharing between D5Act and D5Config is completely open

- D5___Setup
-- extends D5Setup
-- Configure activity ... arguments for either D5Act or other app
-- Returns an updated string-activity pair for display in Dot5 activity
-- Data sharing with D5Act is completely open

- D5___Act
-- The Android activity doing of it ...
--- Potentially does nothing more than launching a third party app: specifying arguments for other apps


~~~ Example: Reading ~~~

- D5ReadSet extends D5Setup
- D5ReadAct extends D5Act
